kxam.patch is loaded and applied one time at boot up
kernel and xam can be patched without reflashing

see included sample patches.s for the format,
it is very similar to freeboot style patches
aside from the fact you are patching the actual
virtual addresses for kernel and xam

the included sample patch is a dummy - DO NOT USE!

Thanks to the original compiler of the win32 assemblers!
